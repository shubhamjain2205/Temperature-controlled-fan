# temperature-controlled-fan
We have built an automatic temperature controlled fan using Arduino which could easily sense and detect the room temperature and then increase or decrease the speed of your fans and exhaust systems. Our device automatically sense the change in temperature using Thermistor and gives command to fans and exhaust systems to control their speed.
